# Invariant demo frontend

A single-page React app (plain JS, no router, no UI/chart library) that
shows live progress and run history for `./demo.sh` (repo root). It talks
only to the 3 read-only endpoints under `invariant.api` (see
`src/invariant/api/main.py`) -- no direct database access, per this
project's frontend/API split (see the repo root `CLAUDE.md`).

## Running it

You need three things running at once, each in its own terminal, from the
repo root unless noted:

```bash
# 1. The API (reads data/demo/status.json + runs.jsonl)
uvicorn invariant.api.main:app --reload

# 2. This dev server
cd frontend
npm install   # first time only
npm run dev

# 3. The actual demo pipeline
./demo.sh
```

Open the URL Vite prints (default `http://localhost:5173`). While
`demo.sh` step 3-9 runs, the page polls `/api/demo/status` every second and
shows a step checklist (done/in-progress/pending, with elapsed time). Once
a run finishes, it shows the FAIL breakdown for all 6 demo containers as
cards, plus a run history table below (bar-per-run total time) built from
every past run recorded in `data/demo/runs.jsonl`.

## Deploying (full remote server running the whole pipeline)

Both halves need to know the *other's* real origin instead of localhost:

```bash
# API side (repo root, or wherever invariant.api runs): allow the real
# frontend origin instead of the localhost:5173 dev default.
export INVARIANT_API_CORS_ORIGINS="https://your-frontend-host"
uvicorn invariant.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Frontend side: point the built page at the real API origin instead of
# localhost:8000, then build a static bundle.
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.production   # edit VITE_API_BASE
npm run build                     # writes dist/ -- serve it with any static file server
```

`demo.sh` itself is unchanged by any of this -- it still assumes
Docker/Postgres/the CLI are on the same machine it runs on, so a "full
remote server" deploy means running `demo.sh`, the API, and this
frontend's built `dist/` all on that one server.

## Notes

- The API base URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`, uvicorn's default) comes from
  `VITE_API_BASE` (see `.env.example`), falling back to that default when
  unset -- right for local dev, override it for a real deploy.
- The ordered list of the 9 pipeline step names in `src/App.jsx`
  (`DEMO_STEPS`) is copied verbatim (Portuguese text included) from
  `demo.sh`'s `section(...)` calls, since the API only reports steps
  completed so far plus the current one, not the full step list ahead of
  time. If a step name changes in `demo.sh`, update it here too.
- No new npm dependencies beyond the Vite React template's own
  (react/react-dom + Vite/oxlint tooling) -- charts are plain CSS bars,
  not a charting library.
